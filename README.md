The Injury Prevention Advisor is an intelligent system designed to predict, prevent, and manage 
injury risks in various environments such as sports, workplaces, and rehabilitation settings. By 
integrating AI techniques and sensor technologies, the system enhances injury prevention 
strategies through real-time data collection, predictive analytics, and adaptive learning. 
It gathers data using wearable sensors, environmental sensors, and biometric devices to track 
movement patterns, posture, muscle strain, and vital signs. Machine learning algorithms analyse 
this data to predict potential injury threats and provide early warnings. The system continuously 
improves by learning from new data, ensuring effectiveness in dynamic environments. 
Based on identified risks, it suggests tailored recommendations like exercise routines, ergonomic 
adjustments, and equipment modifications. Environmental sensors further enhance insights by 
assessing conditions such as temperature and humidity. A user-friendly dashboard provides risk 
alerts, recommendations, and detailed reports for coaches, supervisors, or medical professionals. 
With applications in sports, workplaces, and rehabilitation, the Injury Prevention Advisor offers 
proactive injury management, ensuring safety and well-being..
